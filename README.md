# Note for HacktoberFest

# Blogs

**for contributing blogs it must be in markdown format and must be pushed in blogs folder in the current directory**

# CODESPACE

**you must upload your entire workspace folder consisting of ipynb notebook and dataset as well in the codespace folder**
**remember : dont make the codespace folder dirty else your PR wont be accepted, you must upload a single workspace folder named with your name**

**you can also upload your projects if you have any, but they must be good quality projects and for project also you must upload a single folder consisting of all files, dont make the codespace dirty by pushing multiple files since your PR wont get accepted**
